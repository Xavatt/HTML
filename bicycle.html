    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <div class="column1of3">
        <h3>The First Bicycle</h3>
    <p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same size in-line wheels,
        the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon whuch you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing his feet against the ground, thus rolling
        yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
    </p>
    <p> The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short live popularity
        as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.

    <h3>Further Innovation</h3>
    <p> The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied drectlu to the front wheel. This machine was known as the 
        velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker", since its wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an 
        extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and  indoor riding academies, similar to the roller rinks, could be found in large cities.
